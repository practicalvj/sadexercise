## 1. Executive Summary

The traditional model for customers wanting to integrate with our WMS offerings have been to adopt a self-managed approach. The customers are responsible for building out connectors, transform the payloads expected by our APIs and monitor/observe them utilizing custom build tools. As our services mature, there is a growing demand by the customer base to move these capabilities to a fully managed integration platform service provided out of the box by the WMS suite.
